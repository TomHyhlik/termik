A terminal for data transmission via serial or network

I made myself terminal for USB communication in Qt, cause similar available tools does not satisfy me.
The code can be recompiled for any platform that Qt supports.

## Description
Everything is done using shortcuts which is shown after pressing F1.
Transmit data in the terminal is done by pressing Enter.
